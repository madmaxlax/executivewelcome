							<p><span class="testimonial-quote">"I truly wanted to thank you for such a wonderful day and amazing introduction into Baltimore. I was able to see so much and get a solid feeling about the city and where I can envision us settling. And I was blown away by all the personalized touches you made by introducing me to ..., and arranging the private tour with ...and the wonderful discount to ... Truly, the day was planned so well and I walked away feeling really great about Baltimore and with a strong sense of connection already. Thank you also for gathering all of the school information for me. What a huge project that you saved me from, and I wouldn't have known where to start. I had a lot of time to go through it while we were away and feel like I now have a very good starting point in this daunting process. I can't tell you what a huge help that is to me...."</span>

							<p><span class="testimonial-quote">"Meeting Susie last year has changed the very perception of Baltimore for us and our two young children through a connection with a prestigious private school, learning about BSA's ballet performances that enchanted my daughter, a beautiful quarry and beach fifteen minutes from downtown that delighted our three year old, kayaking in the Inner Harbor, finding Belvedere Square, The Store Limited,...just to mention a few! Susie is someone with a talent for finding <em>what matters most to you</em>. She has an endless stream of great 'try this...' to share.
